# Text Animations by Ignacio Doria

Hi!👋🏻 My name is Ignacio and I've created a bunch of special animations for you to jazz up your projects! To make the most of these animations, I've relied on Framer-motion, a motion library tailored for React. I also did use and the Intersection Observer API. So, before you dive in, make sure you've got it installed.
